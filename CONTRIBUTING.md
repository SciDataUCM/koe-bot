## Rules

- Every Pull Request must have a title.
- Every Pull Request must have a description.
- Write the title and description of what you have done in the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. 
    - âœ… **DO**: Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change". 
    - âœ… **DON'T**: Start with "Fixed", "Added", "Adding", "Changed".
    - ðŸŽ¯ Read â†’ [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end with a period.
- Have fun.
