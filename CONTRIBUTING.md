## Steps to follow

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

## Rules

- **IMPORTANT!** Test your code locally! Follow the steps 'Running KoeBot locally' found at [README](https://github.com/SciDataUCM/koe-bot/blob/master/README.md).
- Don't forget to delete your api keys from your code before uploading it, leave the api keys references as they were before you started working on the code.
- Every Pull Request must have a title.
- Every Pull Request must have a description.
- Write the title and description of what you have done in the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. 
    - ‚úî **DO**: Start the line with "Fix", "Add", "Change". 
    - ‚ùå **DON'T**: Start with "Fixed", "Added", "Adding", "Changed".
    - üéØ Read ‚Üí [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end with a period.
- Have fun.
