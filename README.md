## Who is Koe üê®

Koe is SciDataUCM's Telegram bot (and yep... the koala of the picture above is Koe!).

Koe is always there to help you out answering your SciDataUCM's related questions.

## How can I feed Koe üçΩ	

Just [open a conversation with Koe](https://t.me/KoeBot).

## Where does Koe sleep üõå

Koe uses the [python-telegram-bot API](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) to communicate with Telegram servers and [open-weather-map](https://openweathermap.org/) to implement `/weather`.

## Running KoeBot locally üè†

Clone this repository by running the following command in a terminal capable of running _git_: `git clone https://github.com/SciDataUCM/koe-bot.git`.


You need to create a bot following [Telegram Bots Guide](https://core.telegram.org/bots) in order to use a personal api key and a botname to run this code locally.

Once you have an api key (_token_) and a botname, you should modify `BOTNAME` and `TOKEN` from `koe.py`.

Install all the requirements by following [the guide below](https://github.com/SciDataUCM/koe-bot#requirements-%EF%B8%8F).

Run `koe.py` by running the following command in a terminal capable of running _python_: `python koe.py`. Now the bot should be running so don't stop the execution / don't close the terminal which is running it.

Open a conversation with your bot navigating to the link `https://t.me/BOTNAME` changing `BOTNAME` with your botname.
